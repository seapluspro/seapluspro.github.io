## copy

Copies a text to a buffer. If the parameter append exists the text is appended at the end of the buffer.

There is the possability of a __here document__: the syntax is '<<' followed by the marker or the delimited marker.
All lines following the line of the copy statement are put into the buffer until the marker is found.
The delimited marker means: no interpolation is done.

If the marker is not delimited the text is interpolated: variable names will be replaced by the variable values.

### Syntax

    copy <text> <target> [append]

	copy from <buffer> [starting <start-position>] [including <end-position> | excluding <end-position>] [to <target>] [append]
    
    copy <<<marker> <buffer> [append]
    <line_1>
    ...
    <line_n>
    <marker>

    copy <<'<marker>' <buffer> [append]
    <line_1>
    ...
    <line_m>
    <marker>

### Parameters

- __text__: a string or a buffer expression defining the source of the copy operation
- __target__: the target buffer. Default: the current buffer.
- __buffer__: the source buffer.
- __start-position__: the position in the source buffer where the text to copy begins.
- __end-position__: the position in the source buffer where the text to copy ends.
- __including__: if that keyword is used the end position is part of the contents to copy.
- __excluding__: if that keyword is used the end position is not part of the contents to copy.
- __append__: if that keyword exists the content is appended to the target. Otherwise it replaces the target content.

### Examples

    copy "Hello" main
    copy ~csv:1:2 main append # copy the first 2 lines onto the main buffer
    copy from ~_main starting $(start) excluding $(end) to ~csv
    copy <<EOS append
    line $(start)
    line $(end)
    EOS
    copy <<'EOS'
    line1 $(this_will_be_not_interpolated)
    line2
    EOS
    

## delete

Delete a piece from the current buffer. It can be controlled by:

- A start position
    - "from &lt;position>" deletes including the position
    - "behind &lt;position>" deletes excluding the position
- An end position:
    - "including &lt;position>" deletes including the position
    - "excluding &lt;position>" deletes excluding the position
- A count: 
    - "count &lt;count>" deletes &lt;count> characters in the line defined by the start position.
- Only one of count or end position can be used.

### Syntax

    delete { from | behind ] <start-position> { excluding | including } <end-position> in [<buffer>]
    delete { from | behind ] <start-position> count <count> in <buffer>

### Parameters

- __start-position__: the deletion starts at that position. Syntax of the position is __line:column__.
- __end-position__: the deletion ends at that position. Syntax of the position is __line:column__.
- __count__: that count of characters in the line defined by the start position will be deleted. If the line is too short than fewer characters will be deleted.
- __buffer__: a buffer name. 

### Examples

    pos1 = "3:4"
   	if s/Bob/
   	  bob = $(__start)
   	  if s/Eve/
   	    delete starting $(bob) excluding $(__start) in ~_main
   	  endif
   	endif
   	delete from 1:1 including 1:3 in ~csv
   	delete behind $(pos1) count 3 in ~_data

## insert

Puts a text at a given position.

### Syntax

    insert [<buffer>] <position> <text>

### Parameters

- __buffer__: the name of the buffer where the insertion is done.
- __position__: the insertion is done at that position. Syntax of the position is __line:column__.
- __text__: that text will be inserted. May be a string, a buffer or a buffer expression.

### Examples

    insert ~csv 1:1 "id;name"
    if r/Alice/
      insert $(__start) "Bob and "
    endif
    move s/end of file/
    insert! $(__position) ~csv

## load

Loads a textfile into a buffer.

### Syntax

    load <buffer> <filename>

### Parameters

- __buffer__: the buffer name.
- __filename__: A string: the buffer is filled by the contents of that file.

### Examples

    load ~_main "unprocessed_data.txt"

## log

Puts a text into the buffer named log and display it.

A text may be a string constant or a buffer content.

### Syntax

    log <text>

### Parameters

- __text__: the text to log. May be a string, a buffer or a buffer expression.

### Examples

    log "= start"
    log ~csv:1-3

## select

Selects the buffer where the script should be working ("current buffer").
That is uses in some command as the default buffer.

If the keyword __push__ exists the previous current buffer is stacked. It can be restored with __pop__.

### Syntax

    select [push] <buffer>
    select pop

### Parameters

- __buffer__: the buffer to select.
- __push__: if that keyword is given the current buffername is saved on a stack before selecting the new one.
- __pop__: the previous buffer will be selected.

### Examples

    select ~csv
    select push ~data
    select pop
    # now the previous buffer ~csv is active again

## store

Stores a buffer into a textfile.

### Syntax

    store <buffer> <filename> [append]

### Parameters

- __buffer__: the name of the buffer to store.
- __filename__: a string with the file where the buffer is stored.
- __append__: if that keyword exists the buffer contents is appended to the file. Otherwise it replaces the file contents.

### Examples

    store ~main "processed_data.txt"
    store ~main "all_together.txt" append
